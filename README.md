## Local Development

To run the app in the local development environment run the following command

```bash
npm install

npm start
```
The application will be loaded on port 3000 by default unless this port is busy. http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
And the app is ready to be deployed!<br />
